Both of these old streets disappeared during the renovations in the 1990s. The present building dates from 1871; the interior was renovated in 1992.There are (at least) two explanations for the name. One is that when a horse got the “staggers” it was bled by a farrier at the inn. Another is that the name of the pub comes from an incident during the Battle of Rathmines in 1649, when a wounded horse fled from the battle.","Dublin, County Dublin, Ireland",2000.0,1500.0,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0f/d1/88/3f/outside.jpg?w={width}&h={height}&s=1,4.0,670,Restaurant,

Opening Hours:

Food: 12-9.30pm

This year Mc Grattans celebrates it's 21st anniversary. It was originally known as a one of Dublin's most famous Restaurant's but in recent times it's become one of the cities best loved pub grub venues. Not only that there's the only beer-garden in the Baggot Street area, comfortable surroundings, a laid-back atmosphere and even a couple of pool tables.

The list of celeb's that have passed through Mc Grattans includes U2, Uma Thurmann, Oliver Reed, Pavarotti, in fact too many to mention. But it's not the kind of place to feel star-struck. It's one of the friendliest bars around with great areas for private parties and gatherings. 

Mc Grattans not only does great value food and drink all week but at the weekends turns into a late night destination for some of the cities hippest party goers. A real gem that needs to be explored.
